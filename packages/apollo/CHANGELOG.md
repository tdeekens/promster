### Patch Changes

- [#868](https://github.com/tdeekens/promster/pull/868) [`7a084f2`](https://github.com/tdeekens/promster/commit/7a084f214ef7f7d81e8c06f04b5a7abdbf78c456) Thanks [@earnubs](https://github.com/earnubs)! - Fix GraphQL execution error counting

  This fixes a bug which caused GraphQL errors thrown were not counted when
  encountered in GraphQL execution phase.

  During the execution phase GraphQL request are fulfilled and can result in data or an error.

  Additionally, the any error not handled would threw a plugin error due to a missing label `field_name` in the intial label set.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#791](https://github.com/tdeekens/promster/pull/791) [`7f44d2e`](https://github.com/tdeekens/promster/commit/7f44d2e16b506cb53ff0009f4f74a8ccef192ce0) Thanks [@tdeekens](https://github.com/tdeekens)! - Refactor to use `process.hrtime.bigint()` over `process.hrtime()`.

  The [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#processhrtimetime) lists `process.hrtime([time])` as a [legacy feature](https://nodejs.org/api/documentation.html#stability-index). It is no longer recommended for use, and should be avoided. As such it is recommended to use `process.hrtime.bigint()` which works slightly different.

  This change is backwards compatible. A new `timing` module was added to `@promster/metrics` which encapsulates timings so you never have to worry about the details.

  ```diff
  import { getRequestRecorder } = require('@promster/express');
  +import { timing } = require('@promster/express');

  +const requestTiming = timing.start();
  -const requestTiming = process.hrtime();

  recordRequest(requestTiming);
  ```

  We recommend to change all explicit calls to `process.hrtime()` with calls to `timing.start()` over time. The `recordRequest` function will continue to accept a `[number, number]` as the return of `process.hrtime()` so you can change code as you work with it.
